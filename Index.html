			<p><span class="boldtitle">The American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE)</span> approached us to redesign their extranet. Their tool allows local leaders to manage membership information. We undertook an in-depth User Experience design process that identified user needs, focused attention on the most important features, and set the stage for a fundamental shift in the design. Once we understood the experience we needed to create, we developed an exhaustive set of wireframes and a dynamic visual interface to draw attention to key features, move secondary actions out of the way, and make it as easy as possible for their leaders to accomplish work quickly and efficiently.</p>

			<p><span class="boldtitle">URGENT.LY</span>   Providing drivers with road-side assistance when and where they need it is a simple concept. Creating the digital experience that delivers such service required detailed planning, months of collaboration, and thoughtful design. We led the Urgent.ly team through exhaustive planning of the  features and tailored effective user flows before designing even a pixel of the app. Our wireframe prototypes ensured everyone understood exactly what application we were building and that it met customer demands as well as that of their drivers in their time of need. While we are quite proud of the final interface, it was our work refining the user experience down to its core value and combining features for optimum utility that makes Urgent.ly a powerful tool for drivers.</p>
